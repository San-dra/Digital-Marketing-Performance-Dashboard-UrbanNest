## This Folder Contains the Data Generation Notebooks
This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks used to generate synthetic data for the marketing performance monitoring system. The data generation process is designed to simulate realistic marketing campaign scenarios, including both organic and paid channels. The generated data is stored in Google Sheets, which can be used for further analysis and visualization in Looker Studio.
